 The [NCEPLIBS-external](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-external) project provides an convenient way to install the required TPL on supported platforms such as generic Linux/macOS systems.

## Obtaining, Building, Using NCEPLIBS

### Obtaining the code

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS`

### Building the libraries

`CMake` employs an out-of-source build.  Create a directory for configuring the build and cd into it:

`mkdir -p build && cd build`

Set the compilers, if needed, to match those being used for compiling the TPL listed above: `FC`, `CC`, and `CXX` environment variables can be used to point to the desired Fortran, C, and C++ compilers.

Execute `cmake` from inside your build directory.

`cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<nceplibs-prefix> ../NCEPLIBS`

If the TPL are not located in a path recognized by `cmake` e.g. `/usr/local`, it may be necessary to provide the appropriate environment variables e.g. `<package_ROOT>` or `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` so that `cmake` is able to locate these dependencies.

The installation prefix for NCEPLIBS is provided by the `cmake` command-line argument `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<nceplibs-prefix>`

To build and install:

```
make -j<x>
```

This will build and install all the NCEPLIBS and place them into the installation prefix `<nceplibs-prefix>`.

Additional `cmake` command-line options while configuring NCEPLIBS:

`-DFLAT=ON|OFF` - determines the installation tree heirarchy

`-DDEPLOY=ON|OFF` - prepares and deploys Lua modulefiles for each of the NCEPLIBS libraries.  To deploy modulefiles:
```
make deploy
```
[LMod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Environment module system is required to load/unload these modules.

Some HPC systems use Tcl based Environment modules.  NCEPLIBS provides a means to deploy Tcl module files and can be exercised as follows:

`-DTCLMOD=ON` - enables option to change Lua modulefiles to Tcl modulefiles for each of the NCEPLIBS libraries.  To make the change:
```
make tcl
```

On machines that do not provide access to Github, a `DOWNLOAD_ONLY` and `USE_LOCAL` option is provided.  To download the NCEPLIBS without building them use the cmake command line option `-DDOWNLOAD_ONLY=ON`.  This will download all the NCEPLIBS in a local `download` folder.  `make tarball` will tar and zip this folder into `nceplibs.tgz` which can then be transferred to the machine without GitHub access.  Untar the tarball, and use the cmake command line option `USE_LOCAL` as `-DUSE_LOCAL=ON`.  This will use the source code from the download directory.

### Usage

`NCEPLIBS` can be used in any application that uses `cmake` to configure and build by adding `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<nceplibs-prefix>` to the cmake command line during configuration.
